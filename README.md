# fpv-drone

Currently you can play it only with Gamepad. I tested only with xbox controller, also it supports Radiomaster Zorro.

Left stick Y axis to control drone throttle, X axis to control yaw. 
Right stick to control roll and pitch. 
Right shoulder to reset drone position. 
Button B to open menu. 
Button A to select menu item. 
Button Y to switch between day and night.
Currently it's only full manual/ PRO mode. So if you haven't tried flying FPV drone, it may be really tricky for you.
